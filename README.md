# Homework 3
# CS 212 Nature of Computation, Fall 2021

---

# Purpose

This homework provides practice in the pumping lemma for context free languages, Turing machines, and languages that a Turing machine can decide and recognize.

# Background

For this assignment, you should be able to
- apply the pumping lemma for context free languages,
- define a Turing machine, both formally and informally,
- construct a Turing machine for a given language,
- define and distinguish between Turing recognizable and decidable languages,
- construct proofs,
- work in LaTeX.

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw3.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to this assignment.

## 3.1 Solving the Problem Set

Insert your solutions in `solution` environments in `hw3.tex`. The file named `hw3.tex` in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your team's submission. Make sure that any included files, e.g. image files, are also present in the repository.

This is a team submission on GitHub and contributes to your _Submission Score_.

Deadline: 2359h on Sunday, 14 November.

## 3.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your buddies and on the assignment through a from which will be available on LMS with further instructions. The form will be due at the same time as the problem set.

This is an individual submission on LMS and contributes to your individual _Team Factor_ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission or non-participation in the team as assessed through peer feedback or GitHub contribution.

Deadline: 2359h on Sunday, 14 November.

# Grading

Your submission will be graded for correctness of your solutions. __Files that are missing, badly named, or do no compile cannot be graded__. 

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.

# Discussion

Please use the following avenues:

- discuss with your buddy,
- the discussion thread on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- consult with course staff.

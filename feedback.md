- (non-deterministic) Turing Machines
- LaTeX, debugging
- collaboration, especially when Github went down
- use of pumping lemma in proving a language to be CFG or non-CFG
- theorm for infinite Turing recognizable language
- operations under which Turing recognizable languages are closed and their proofs also
- thinking with respect to different cases
- gave me idea of computing complexity of worst and best case in processing some string in certain steps.
- how to design a turning machine to decide a particular language
- the computational complexity of a given computational problem.
- constructed a Turing machine for a given language
- distinguished between Turing recognizable and Turing decidable
- clear idea why turing machines are better than PDA and how the infinite tape is of so much benefit
- computability, complexity and decidability
- how to prove certain properties of a Turing Machine
- how to give a proof/explanation of the complexities of certain problems
- about the problems described in the questions
- defining a TM (both formally and with a high level description); 
- Better understanding of pumping lemma.
- Understanding how languages, computability and decidability really come together.
- how to build intuition for turing machines, writing their hugh level description
- found jflap and it was really helpful
- build intuition for time complexity
- State diagrams for Turing Machines.
- justify the decidability of a given computational problem
- describe the computational complexity of a given computational problem.

Improvement
--

- perfect, no improvement, homework was self explanatory, satisfied with the content, it was well designed, perfect in terms of difficulty and the time given to complete it, fun and challenging, very interesting, pretty easy to understand, questions were well-made, best version out of the three homeworks that we've done. Questions where defined clearly
- fewer questions
- The last question was too abstract, a hint or explanation would be helpful, was very hard to understand, a little too theoretical and little different from what we studied, more hints needed, a similar problem could have been done in recitation, should have been a bonus question.
- The questions related to construction of turing machines should be atleast 2 so that each team member gets a good idea about it.
- more questions in homework for us to be more fmiliarized with the concepts.
- More proofs for time complexity bounds
- more, shorter questions so as to cover more concepts
- short proofs and more questions.
- By giving more clear instructions
- number of questions be a multiple of 2 and 3, to allow for easy division of work
- more design problems for Turing Machines.
- a marked bonus point question
- programming aspect could be introduced
- homeworks should be individual as team honeworks add additional logistical issues.
- include a small programming exercise, like creating a working simulation for state machines.
- adding some diagrams or illustrations.
- Adding more questions about Turing Machines
- simpler questions
- more time
- Division of marks could have been better.

Other
-

- helped me in practicing what we have learned in our lectures
- structure was good which helped me in strengthening my understanding of the topics.
- adequate number of questions
- we have not gone really in depth of time complexities
- doable, with sufficient, reasonable number of questions, difficulty level was also not way too high
- Homework 3 is all about proves which was not as fun it sounded before but I learned a lot from it.
- the preceding homework should be checked before the release of the next (especially if there is some overlap in the content covered) in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes (provided they were made in the first place).
-  Tired of writing proofs :(
